This was my second project in java script the first being MineSweeper. I decided on this project
beacause i enjoy playin Wordle so i thoguht i would make a Slovenian version. I had alot of fun
facing certain problems with this project especially with the slovenian language containing č, š, ž
and how to implement these letters in my code. I learned alot about the input codes of different keys on the keyboard
and how to use them in my code.
