I started this project as a way to learn coding in java script. The project was fun and educational.
I wrote the code with the help of tutorials i found on YouTube and with the help of js syntax and ChatGPT.
The biggest problems i faced were zooming and keeping the board contained while zooming occured. I learned alot
about user inputs and event listeners during this project.
